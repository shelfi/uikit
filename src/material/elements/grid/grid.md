[Api Doc](https://material.angularjs.org/#/api/material.components.gridList/directive/mdGridList)

Grid lists are an alternative to standard list views. Grid lists are distinct from grids used for layouts and other visual presentations.

A grid list is best suited to presenting a homogenous data type, typically images, and is optimized for visual comprehension and differentiating between like data types.

A grid list is a continuous element consisting of tessellated, regular subdivisions called cells that contain tiles (md-grid-tile).
